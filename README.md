This is a fork of osm2pgsql.  It adds a `--relation-index` flag, which takes a `.relidx` file generated from `relindex` in [osmindex](https://github.com/squizzling/osmindex) repo.

For general usage, please refer to the original repo.  For any support, raise an issue, but you're probably on your own.

My code is trash, C++ is an unfamiliar language to me.  But it does what I need it to, maybe it will do what you need it to, too.
